STATUS: Finished.

ORIGINAL IDEA: Yes. It's a common idea but I didn't got it from anyone, any resemblance to other projects is purely coincidental.

ORIGINAL CODE: Yes.

TIME SPENT: HTML & CSS => 12/08/23 ~ 13/08/23 --- JS => 13/08/23 ~ 17/08/23 

HELP RECEIVED: None but ChatGPT's.

THINGS I HAVE LEARNT: Numerous. I have assimilated the usage of DOM, yet I humbly recognize that there is more for me to learn - I got used to use query selectors, add events listeners, create and delete elements, add and remove classes and id's. I have gained a deeper understanding of the logic behind JavaScript, how 'it thinks'.

FEATURES I COULD NOT MANAGE TO IMPLEMENT and REASONS WHY: Outline for the different png when hovered (when given certain conditions) - as far as I know, CSS does not have such feature.

DISCARDED FEATURES and REASONS WHY: A yellow 'Play again' button - it lost sense.

LOOKING FORWARD TO: Optimization, simplicity and cleanliness.

WILL I REVISIT and WHY WOULD I: Surely - I do not know when or why. I consider there is not much to be added.

CREDITS: Every png was downloaded from iconduck.com.

I am willing to retire them at the creators' request.
